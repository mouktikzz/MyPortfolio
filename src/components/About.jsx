            As a versatile tech enthusiast, I blend creativity with technical prowess to bring ideas to life. From coding in Python, C, C++, JAVA, SQL, C# and MATLAB to crafting engaging websites with HTML, CSS, JS, and WordPress, I am passionate about all things tech.<br /><br />
            With game development, I've recreated classics like Angry Birds and Flappy Bird etc., using Unity 2D, focusing on the meticulous replication of gameplay mechanics and visual style. Beyond recreation, Iâ€™ve ventured into original game designs, developing titles like Present Collector and Mad Doctor etc., where I've implemented dynamic game mechanics and engaging user interfaces.<br /><br />
            My penetration testing, using tools like Burp Suite, NMAP, Metasploit reflect my keen interest in cybersecurity. Completing internships with top-tier companies like Palo Alto has further honed these skills.<br /><br />
            On the creative front, I leverage design tools including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and Blender to bring a visual flair to my projects. My expertise also extends to generative AI, utilizing platforms like DALL-E and Midjourney to explore new frontiers in AI-driven creativity.<br /><br />
            Whether it's through problem-solving, collaboration, or the detailed execution of a project, my focus remains on delivering quality and innovative solutions. Feel free to connect or delve into my diverse projects to understand how I can add value to your team or project.
